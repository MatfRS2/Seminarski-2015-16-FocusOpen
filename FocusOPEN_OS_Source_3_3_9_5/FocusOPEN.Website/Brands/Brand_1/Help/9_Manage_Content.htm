<p>The Manage Asset Types feature allows Super Administrators to add, edit and delete asset or media type groups to avoid the need for separate filtering options for every kind of file type.

<ul>
<li>Select 'Manage Content > Manage Asset Types' from the main navigation in the
Admin Area. The Manage Asset Types screen will be displayed.</li>
<li>To add a new type, enter the name in the field at the bottom of the page.</li>
<li>Click [add new] to assign file extensions to the asset type.  This will take you to the File Extension Manager.</li>
<li>File extensions can only exist in a single asset type, it is not possible to assign an extension to multiple types simultaneously.</li>
<li>Asset Types cannot be deleted if they have assets assigned to them, however, they can be made invisible which will prevent them from being selected in searches and during cataloguing.</li>
