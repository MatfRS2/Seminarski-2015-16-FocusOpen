<p>Having <a href="#view_orders">selected an order to view</a>, the contents of that order are displayed below in the asset list.  The feedback to the far right of the asset thumbnail and details indicates the current status of each asset: approved (or approval not required), rejected, pending and expired.  Only approved assets may be <a href="#downloading_assets">downloaded</a>.</p>

<a name="approved"></a>
<H3>Approved & Approval Rejected</H3>
<p>Only approved assets can be downloaded from the Download Manager.  Assets either: do not require approval and may be downloaded immediately from the Download Manager, or: are approved for use on a case-by-case basis by an Upload User.  On approval, these assets then become available to download via the Download Manager.  If an Upload User rejects your application to use an asset, the asset will display an "approval rejected" notification to the right of the asset thumbnail and details in the Download Manager and will not be available to download.  Further details regarding usage or why an application has been rejected can be viewed by clicking the "Show Approval Notes" beneath the asset details.</p>

<p>Note: Approval Notes are only available for assets which have required approval by an Upload User.</p>

<H3>Approval Pending</H3>
<p>If an asset in the asset list requires approval by an Upload User, but has not yet been administered, the asset status displays as "Approval Pending" to the far right of the asset thumbnail and details.  This asset is not downloadable until approved.  Note: You will receive an email notification to your registered inbox when a decision has been made.</p>

<H3>Expired</H3>
  <p>To ensure that assets up-to-date and relevant to the mission and business, 
    all assets are set to expire for reconsideration by System Administrators. 
    Assets which have expired will continue to be displayed in the asset list, 
    but are no longer available for download via the system. Expired assets display 
    the status "Expired" to the far right of the asset thumbnail and details.
