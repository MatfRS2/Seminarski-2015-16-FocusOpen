<div class="Cnt">
<p>Having <a href="#view_orders">selected an order to view</a>, the contents of that order are displayed below in the asset list.  The feedback to the far right of the asset thumbnail and details indicates the current status of each asset: approved (or approval not required), rejected, pending and expired.  Only approved assets may be <a href="#downloading_assets">downloaded</a>.</p>

<a name="approved"></a>
<H3>Approved & Approval Rejected</H3>
<p>Only approved assets can be downloaded from My Orders. Assets either: do not require approval and may be downloaded immediately, or: are approved for use on a case-by-case basis by an Admisitrator. On approval, these assets then become available to download via My Orders. If an Admisitrator rejects your application to use an asset (see Order Conversation), the asset will display an "approval rejected" notification to the right of the asset thumbnail and details in My Orders and will not be available to download. Further details regarding usage or why an application has been rejected can be viewed via the Order Conversation.  Note: The Order Conversation is only shown for assets which require approval by an Administrator.</p>

<H3>Approval Pending</H3>
<p>If an asset in the asset list requires approval by an Administrator, but has not yet been administered, the asset status displays as "Approval Pending" to the far right of the asset thumbnail and details.  This asset is not downloadable until approved.  Note: You may be required to provide further information (see the Order Conversation for further information).</p>

<H3>Expired</H3>
  <p>To ensure that assets are up-to-date and relevant, all assets are set to expire after a certain time period.  Administrators will then either delete or renew the asset on the system.  Assets which have expired will continue to be displayed in the asset list, but are no longer available for download via the system. Expired assets display the status "Expired" to the far right of the asset thumbnail and details.</p>

</div>

<a name="order_conversation"></a>
<H3>The Order Conversation</H3>
<p>Assets that require approval are referred to an Administrator.  The Administrator can then use the Order Conversation features to ascertain any further information regarding usage or ensure that certain usage restrictions are bought to the attention of the user.  The user may respond to the Administrator via the 'Comments' texfield. All comments made in conversations between Administrators and users are displayed in the Conversation field and are also relayed via email.  Once assets in an order are approved or rejected, the user will receive notification via email and via the asset status on the My Orders screen.</p>
