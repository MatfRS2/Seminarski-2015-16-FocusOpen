<p>Having <a href="1_Getting_Started.htm#registration">registered with the system</a>, users of FocusOPEN Digital Asset Manager may access the system via either an internal or external account:</p>
<a name="internal_users"></a>
<H3>Internal User & Administrator Accounts</H3>
  <p>Employees who have registered internal email addresses, have internal user 
    accounts. Internal accounts support both user and administrator roles. After 
    internal user accounts expire, users receive a security prompt to reactivate 
    their accounts. Only super administrator accounts can be set to never expire. 
    Administrator roles are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="SubHdr">Upload Users</span><br />
      Have access to <a href="8_Manage_Assets.htm">Asset Management</a> and <a href="7_Manage_Orders.htm">Order 
      Management</a> features. Upload Users are responsible for all assets uploaded 
      to the system by themselves and are required to respond to usage requests 
      for those assets which have download rights applied. View rights are restricted 
      to those assets or orders for which they are responsible.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li><span class="SubHdr">Brand Administrators</span><br />
    </li>
    Have access to <a href="8_Manage_Assets.htm">Asset Management</a>, <a href="7_Manage_Orders.htm">Order 
    Management</a> and some <a href="#manage_users">User Management</a> features. 
    Business User Administrators support Upload Users in their Brand and 
    can view all users, assets, orders and reports specific to their Business 
    Unit.<br />
    <br />
    <li><span class="SubHdr">Super Administrators</span><br />
      Have access to <span class="Bold">all</span> administration features, including 
      <a href="9_Manage_Content.htm">Content Management</a> and <a href="10_Utilities.htm">Utilities</a>. 
      Super Administrators support Upload and Brand Administrators and 
      can view all users, assets, orders and reports system-wide.</li>
  </ul>
  <a name="home_use"></a>
  <p><span class="SubHdr">Home Use Permitted</span><br />
    Checking the 'Home Use Permitted' checkbox (available from the Edit User screen), 
    allows users to access the Media Library from outside the corporate network 
    (for example, from home). Note: This option is available to employees 
    only.</p>

<a name="external_users"></a>
<H3>External User Accounts</H3>
<p>Approved third-party companies (for example: agencies) who access the system from outside the corporate network and who have had <a href="#manage_companies">applied to have their domain registered with the system by a Super Administrator</a>, have external user accounts.  External accounts do not support administration roles and automatically expire ten days after activation.</p>
