attributing <a href="#metadata">metadata</a> to an asset so that it can be retrieved in searches and used
without breach of <a href="#rights">copyright or other usage rights</a>.</p>
<H3>Step One: Finding & Selecting Assets To Catalogue</H3>
<p>To find and select assets which have been
uploaded to the system to catalogue:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select 'Manage Assets > Catalogue Assets' from the main navigation in the
Admin Area. The Catalogue Assets: Step One screen will be displayed.
Note: Only assets uploaded by you will be available for you to catalogue. If
you have not uploaded any assets to the system and none are available for
you to catalogue, the system will display feedback to this effect.</li>
<li>To retrieve uploaded assets to catalogue:
Select the type of asset which you want to catalogue (to see all available
assets, select the 'All' option from the 'Type' dropdown menu). A list of
uploaded assets is displayed in the 'File Reference' list menu below.</li>
    <li>To select the assets to catalogue in this session: Click on an asset file 
      reference in the 'File Reference' list menu. For your reference a thumbnail 
      of the asset selected is displayed alongside the list menu. Note: Hold down 
      the CTRL key and click to select more than one asset to catalogue or to 
      deselect an asset. To select all assets displayed in the list menu, click 
      the 'select all assets' link beneath the list menu.</li>
<li>Press the 'Catalogue Selected' button to confirm your selection for this
session and <a href="#cataloguing_assets2">proceed to the next step</a>.</li>

<p>Templates provide a quick and convenient method for reapplying the metadata
added for one asset to all other assets selected for cataloguing in a session.
To use templates, select one of the following options from the Select Templates section:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select the 'use the first asset as a template for the others' radio button
to nominate the first asset which you catalogue as a template for all
other assets catalogued in that session. In this way, once the first
asset has been catalogued, this data will be applied to all subsequent
assets which you catalogue in that session.
Note: If you need to make changes to any subsequent assets, you will
be able to do so on a <a href="#cataloguing_assets2">case-by-case basis</a>.<br /><br /></li>
<li>Select the 'use another asset as a template' radio button to nominate
an asset which has previously been catalogued, as a template for all
others. In this way, the data from a catalogued asset can be used as a
template for all subsequent assets which you catalogue in that
session.<br /><br />
To nominate a catalogued asset as a template for all others in a
session:<br />
Enter the reference number of the asset into the text field next to the
'use another asset as a template' radio button. To view the details for
the asset entered, click the 'view' link to the right of the text field. The
Asset Details window is displayed.
Note: If you need to make changes to any subsequent assets, you will
be able to do so on a <a href="#cataloguing_assets2">case-by-case basis</a>.<br /><br />
      To find the reference number for an asset which has already been catalogued, 
      select the "Catalogue" link from the Admin main menu and <a href="2_Searching.htm">search 
      to find an asset</a>.<br />

asset from the file, for example: File Size, File Format, File Name and File Metadata (EXIF, XMP or IPTC data).<br /><br />

<span class="Bold">General Metadata</span><br />
Information about the asset, for example: Originator, Title, Asset Type.<br /><br />

<span class="Bold">Subject Metadata</span><br />
This will be unique to each implementation and depends on how your administrator has configured the metadata for your edition of FocusOPEN.

Any restriction on the usage of an asset. This may be particular to a
context (for example, use in print media) or general usage (for
example, logo minimum size and exclusion zone).<br /><br />

<span class="Bold">Attached Files</span><br />
You can attach additional files to assets (in addition to the asset itself).  Typically this might include licence documents, logo usage guidelines, fonts or other items that need to accompany the asset.

Download restrictions prevent users from downloading an asset from
FocusOPEN Digital Asset Manager without approval. Download restrictions are
applied by default and include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Permission required to download<br />
Requires non-administrator users to request to download an asset.  This commences usage approval (download) workflow where administrators decide if a request is approved or rejected.</li>

<li>Watermark Preview<br />
A watermark is superimposed over the asset preview so that the
preview cannot be downloaded and reused without permission.
Watermarks can be added to both image and video previews.</li>

<li>Not visible to external users (e.g. agencies)<br />
The asset (including the asset preview) is not visible to users outside
of the corporate network and is
not returned in search results.</li>

Information related to the asset's publication status on the system. A
publication date must be set for all assets, but no expiry date can also be specified if an expiry is not required. The publication date denotes the date on which the asset will be available for users
browse and download via the catalogue. The expiry date denotes the
date on which the asset will be removed from searches and will no
longer be available to download.

<p>Note: users who have ordered an asset prior to its expiry date will still
view a reference to that asset in their order history but will be no
longer able to download that asset.</p>

<p>To Publish An Asset:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set the publication date for the date on which you want the
asset to become available. Note: The current date will be selected by default.</li>
<li>If required, set the expiry date for the date on which you want the asset to
become unavailable. If the asset has been acquired
from a third party and there is an embargo date beyond which
it should not be used, make sure you enter it here. Note: A date two years in advance of the current date will be selected by default.  To not specify an expiry date option, set the radio button to Asset Expires: No.</li>
</ul>

The next section depends on whether you are required to submit assets to a workflow<br />

<ul>
<li>If not, you will have a 'Publish This Asset' checkbox which can be ticked to confirm that the
asset can be published to the system. <span class="Bold">Note: Assets will not be available to users via the catalogue unless this checkbox is checked.</span>
Checking the 'publish this asset 'checkbox will immediately publish the asset
to the system if the current date is after the publication date set and before the
expiry.</li>

<li>If you are required to submit assets to a workflow, this checkbox will say 'submit to workflow' instead.  When you save the asset, emails will be sent to the administrators to ask them to review your request to publish and either approve or reject it.  Once the asset is submitted, it cannot be edited again unless approved or rejected.</li>

      of the Save options below is selected):<br />
      <br />
Save & Previous<br />
Available if you have selected more than one asset to catalogue in this
session. Press the 'Save & Previous' button to save the information applied
to the asset and move to the previous asset in the selection (reference
number is displayed on the button). Note: This option is not available if the
asset is the first in the selection.<br /><br />
Save & Exit<br />
Press the 'Save & Exit' button to save the information applied to the asset
and exit from the cataloguing process. Note: You will have to retrieve and re-select
assets to be catalogued if this option is exercised.<br /><br />
Save & Next<br />
Available if you have selected more than one asset to catalogue in this
session. Press the 'Save & Next' button to save the information applied to
the asset and move to the next asset in the selection (reference number is
displayed on the button). Note: This option is not available if the asset is the
last in the selection.<br /><br />
Cancel<br />
Press the 'Cancel' button to cancel the cataloguing process. Note: Any
changes will be lost.
</li>
</ul>
Note: it is possible to save an asset without publishing it or submitting it for approval.  Also, assets that are only being saved rather than published do not need to be completed in full and required fields can be left blank until you are ready to publish or submit for approval.
