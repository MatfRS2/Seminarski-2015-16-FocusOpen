<H3>About Search Grammar</H3>
<p>To search for assets in the FocusOPEN Digital Asset Manager you must enter a search term (or terms) into the search field. You can use search grammar to further refine your results.  Note: Case is ignored when searching for terms.  Follow the tips below to see how you can get better results from your searches:</p>
<ol>
<!--tips-->
<li>Tip 1: <a href="#add">Using more than one word</a></li>
<li>Tip 2: <a href="#exact">Using speech marks to find exact phrases ("")</a></li>
<li>Tip 3: <a href="#or">Using OR</a></li>
<li>Tip 4: <a href="#not">Using NOT (-)</a></li>
<li>Tip 5: <a href="#wildcard">Using Wildcards (*)</a></li>
<!--/tips-->
</ol>

<div class="HozLineFine"></div>

<!--tip 1-->
<a name="add"></a>
<H3>Using more than one word</H3>
<p>If you add more than one search term, then the system will look for assets which relate to all those terms.  For example:<br /><br />
<img src="images/tip1.gif" width="367" height="31"><br /><br />
    Will return all results to which the words 'Bunch' AND 'Grapes' have been 
    applied. Note: You do not have to type the word 'AND' between search terms. 
    The system will look for assets which relate to all search terms entered with 
    spaces in between. This will narrow your search criteria and is useful if 
    too many results are being found. This technique can also be used to search 
    within results.</p>
<!--/tip 1 -->

<div class="HozLineFine"></div>

<!--tip 2-->
<a name="exact"></a>
<H3>Using speech marks to find exact phrases ("")</H3>
<p>Use speech marks around a search phrase to find assets to which that exact phrase has been applied.  For example:<br /><br />
<img src="images/tip2.gif" width="367" height="31"><br /><br />
Will return all results to which the exact phrase "Bunch of Grapes" has been applied. This will narrow your search criteria and is useful if too many results are being found.</p>
<!--/tip 2 -->

<div class="HozLineFine"></div>

<!--tip 3-->
<a name="or"></a>
<H3>Using OR</H3>
<p>Use 'OR' between search terms to find assets to which any of the search terms have been applied. For example:<br /><br />
<img src="images/tip3.gif" width="367" height="31"><br /><br />
Will return all results to which either the word 'Bunch' or 'Grapes' has been applied. Note: This includes assets to which both words have been applied. This will widen your search criteria and is useful if no search results are being found.</p>
<!--/tip 3 -->

<div class="HozLineFine"></div>

<!--tip 4-->
<a name="not"></a>
<H3>Using NOT (-)</H3>
  <p>Use NOT (represented by - ) to find assets which apply to the term(s) to the 
    left of the '-', but which do not apply to the term(s) to the right of the 
    '-'. For example:<br />
    <br />
    <img src="images/tip4.gif" width="367" height="31"><br />
    <br />
    Will return all results to which the word 'Bunch' applies, but not the word 
    'Grapes'. This will narrow your search criteria and is useful if too many 
    results are being found. Note: There should be <span class="Bold">no</span> 
    space between the proceeding search term and the '-'.
  <p>
<!--/tip 4 -->

<div class="HozLineFine"></div>

<!--tip 5-->
<a name="wildcard"></a>
<H3>Using Wildcards (*)</H3>
<p>Use wildcards (represented by *) to find assets to which the term or any related nouns, adjectives, verbs and adverbs have been applied. For example:<br /><br />
<img src="images/tip5.gif" width="367" height="31"><br /><br />
    Will return all results to which the term 'Bunch' or any related words 'Bunched', 
    'Bunching', 'Bunches' have been applied. This will widen your search criteria 
    and is useful if no search results are being found. Note: There should be 
    <span class="Bold">no</span> space between the search term and the '*'.</p>
